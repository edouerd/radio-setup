> “I think that the Internet is going to be extremely important. Information about collections and designers’ philosophies will become accessible across the world, independently of the physical location of stores or showrooms. A designer label’s website will have the same role as a catalog at an exhibition — not a replacement for the actual confrontation with the garments, but an introduction or reminder. However, information on the Internet has to be presented properly. Not in the current playful mode like a computer game, but seriously as a new classic means of information. We are currently working on an extension of our website, including information on the fabric for each garment, etc. This will then function as a professional lookbook for the press when they need to order outfits for photographic shoots, and also as a source of information for the wider public, i.e. information on where the items can be purchased. The Internet has given us the opportunity to pass on information directly to the consumer, without detours or interim interpretations” — Helmut Lang
